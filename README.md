- HI -
I'm Adrian Vasile,
an engineering student that works hard for his dreams...

The concept of free education and open source are very deeply nested in my beliefs,
thanks to those I've been able to grow and connect and I wish that more people will
understand the meaning and strenght of education, and to do that I want to make it 
more accessible

- WHAT I KNOW -
We'll to be honest not alot,
but that's the best thing!
